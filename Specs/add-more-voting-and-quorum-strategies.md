Add the requirements, technical or not.

37. **Vote Counter:** Tallies votes for different options, ensuring that each replica (or user ID) can only vote once.
38. **Approval Quorum:** A boolean-like state that only becomes `true` after a certain number of unique replicas have registered an "approve" operation.
39. **Leader Election Strategy:** A deterministic strategy where replicas can nominate themselves, and the one with the lexicographically highest replica ID (or other deterministic tie-breaker) becomes the "leader."

Make only the ones that do not break the public API, except the metadata and other models. Avoid breaking the interface public APIs.

Use the `CrdtMetadataManager` to provide utilities for metadata management.

## Requirements context
<!---
Add files that we will load for the UI to add context for the solution design.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)

# Testing Methodology
<!---
Add the testing methodology (manual, unit, integration, end-to-end tests?)
--->
Unit tests will be created for each new strategy to ensure they correctly generate patches and apply operations, leading to a converged state. We will test for various scenarios, including concurrent changes from different replicas, to validate the conflict-resolution logic.
The tests have to contain idepontence, commutativity and assosiativity.

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Solutions [AI - Stage 1]
<!---
Here you will need to put a number of solutions that would fit for this problem.
Add the solutions that you rejected as well.
--->

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Techical Steps
<!---
Here you should append the tasks that you probably need to do.
An example would be like what files you need to create and what functionality those files would have.
--->

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Files Needed
<!---
Here you need to list the files you need to load in order to get the correct context for your solution to build and test.
Put in this list only the exising files that need to be modified/loaded. Not the new ones that need to be created.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)
With each file in one line.
Remember to ask to load any unit tests if they are related to any files you will want to change.

<!---AI - Stage 2--->
# Changes Done
<!---
Here you add detailed information about all the changes actually done.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)
Add all the things that you did in a different way than expected.
--->

<!---AI - Stage 2--->
# Manual Changes Needed
<!---
Here you add detailed information about all the manual changes that might be needed to be done from a human.
Example types of changes are:
	- Configuration settings
	- Environment variables
	- Deployments/Scripts/Setups external to this app
	- Dependencies to external projects that would need changes (like nuget packages for example)
	- Settings in other systems (for example, enable some flag or permissions in Github)
If there are none, then just write "No manual changes needed to be applied."

<!---AI - Stage 2--->
## Possible Techical Debt
<!---
Here you add comments about possible technical debt you encountered or implemented but it was too much to change or out of scope.
--->

<!---AI - Stage 2--->
## Last notes and implementation details
<!---
Here you add comments about the implementation that didn't fit on the previous section.
--->

# Code Revisions
<!---
Usually stuff are not working as we expect. This section is for the extra info that we make after this implementation.
This section is reserved for AI and human, but add only when you are instructed to.

# Purpose
To integrate the new strategy pattern into the `JsonCrdtPatcher` service. The patcher will be updated to inspect POCO properties for strategy attributes, resolve the correct `ICrdtStrategy` implementation, and delegate the patch generation logic to that strategy. This makes the patcher extensible and centralizes the strategy selection logic.

<!---Human--->
# Requirements
- Modify `IJsonCrdtPatcher` and `JsonCrdtPatcher` to support patch generation directly from POCOs. A new overload like `GeneratePatch<T>(CrdtDocument<T> original, CrdtDocument<T> current)` should be created.
- The service will use reflection to iterate over the properties of the generic type `T`.
- For each property, it will check for the presence of a `CrdtStrategyAttribute`.
- It needs a mechanism (e.g., a strategy resolver/factory, potentially using DI) to get an instance of the `ICrdtStrategy` corresponding to the attribute.
- If no attribute is found, it must default to using the `LwwStrategy`.
- The patcher will then invoke the `GenerateOperations` method on the resolved strategy for that property, passing the necessary context (e.g., path, old/new values, metadata).
- The service must aggregate the operations generated by all strategies into a single `CrdtPatch`.

# Testing Methodology
- Update `JsonCrdtPatcherTests` to include new tests for the POCO-based `GeneratePatch<T>` method.
- Tests should cover scenarios with:
    - A mix of properties with explicit strategy attributes (`LwwStrategyAttribute`, `CrdtCounterAttribute`) and properties with no attribute (defaulting to LWW).
    - Complex, nested POCOs.
- Verify that the correct strategy is invoked for each property and that the final patch is accurate.

# Proposed Solutions [AI - Stage 1]
<!---
Here you will need to put a number of solutions that would fit for this problem.
Add the solutions that you rejected as well.

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Techical Steps
<!---
Here you should append the tasks that you probably need to do.
An example would be like what files you need to create and what functionality those files would have.
--->

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Files Needed
<!---
Here you need to list the files you need to load in order to get the correct context for your solution to build and test.
Put in this list only the exising files that need to be modified/loaded. Not the new ones that need to be created.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)
With each file in one line.
Remember to ask to load any unit tests if they are related to any files you will want tochange.

# Changes Done
<!---
Here you add detailed information about all the changes actually done.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)
Add all the things that you did in a different way than expected.

<!---AI - Stage 2--->
# Manual Changes Needed
<!---
Here you add detailed information about all the manual changes that might be needed to be done from a human.
Example types of changes are:
	- Configuration settings
	- Environment variables
	- Deployments/Scripts/Setups external to this app
	- Dependencies to external projects that would need changes (like nuget packages for example)
	- Settings in other systems (for example, enable some flag or permissions in Github)
If there are none, then just write "No manual changes needed to be applied."

# Code Revisions

Usually stuff are not working as we expect. This section is for the extra info that we make after this implementation.
This section is reserved for AI and human, but add only when you are instructed to.

# Purpose
To update the `JsonCrdtApplicator` service to correctly apply patches that contain operations generated by different strategies, such as the new `Increment` operation from the `CounterStrategy`. This ensures that the merge logic is consistent with the patch generation logic.

<!---Human--->
# Requirements
- Modify `IJsonCrdtApplicator` and `JsonCrdtApplicator` to handle patch application for strongly-typed POCOs. This might require a new generic method overload like `ApplyPatch<T>(CrdtDocument<T> document, CrdtPatch patch)`.
- When applying a patch, the service needs to determine which strategy should handle each `CrdtOperation`.
- The applicator will need to inspect the target POCO type `T` to find the correct strategy for the JSON path specified in the operation.
- It will use reflection on type `T` to find the property corresponding to the operation's path.
- Based on the `CrdtStrategyAttribute` on that property (or lack thereof), it will resolve the correct `ICrdtStrategy` instance.
- It will then call the `ApplyOperation` method of the resolved strategy to perform the merge.
- The applicator must correctly handle new `OperationType`s like `Increment` by dispatching them to the appropriate strategy (`CounterStrategy`).

# Testing Methodology
- Update `JsonCrdtApplicatorTests` with new tests for applying patches to strongly-typed `CrdtDocument<T>` objects.
- Test the application of patches containing a mix of operations: `Upsert`, `Remove`, and `Increment`.
- Verify that the final state of the POCO is correct after the patch is applied, confirming that each operation was routed to and handled by the correct strategy.

# Proposed Solutions [AI - Stage 1]
<!---
Here you will need to put a number of solutions that would fit for this problem.
Add the solutions that you rejected as well.

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Techical Steps
<!---
Here you should append the tasks that you probably need to do.
An example would be like what files you need to create and what functionality those files would have.
--->

<!---AI - Stage 1--->
# Proposed Files Needed
<!---
Here you need to list the files you need to load in order to get the correct context for your solution to build and test.
Put in this list only the exising files that need to be modified/loaded. Not the new ones that need to be created.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)
With each file in one line.
Remember to ask to load any unit tests if they are related to any files you will want tochange.

# Changes Done
<!---
Here you add detailed information about all the changes actually done.
Format this list in the following way:
	- `$/<Full file path from solution root>` (Reason to be used/loaded)
Add all the things that you did in a different way than expected.

<!---AI - Stage 2--->
# Manual Changes Needed
<!---
Here you add detailed information about all the manual changes that might be needed to be done from a human.
Example types of changes are:
	- Configuration settings
	- Environment variables
	- Deployments/Scripts/Setups external to this app
	- Dependencies to external projects that would need changes (like nuget packages for example)
	- Settings in other systems (for example, enable some flag or permissions in Github)
If there are none, then just write "No manual changes needed to be applied."

# Code Revisions

Usually stuff are not working as we expect. This section is for the extra info that we make after this implementation.
This section is reserved for AI and human, but add only when you are instructed to.
